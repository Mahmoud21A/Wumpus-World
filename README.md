# Wumpus-World

Wumpus World is a game wherein a hunter explores a dark cave in search of a bounty of gold. The cave is represented by a 4x4 grid totaling 16 rooms. The hunter, normally, has no knowledge of the rooms beyond his own. The cave is mired with dangers. A few rooms contain bottomless pits in which the hunter may fall into. One room in the cave is home to the Wumpus, another danger to the hunterâ€™s life. A few rooms have indicators that alert the hunter to a nearby threat. If the hunter feels a breeze, it means that a bottomless pit may be in an adjacent room. If the hunter smells a stench, it means that the Wumpus may be in an adjacent room. If the hunter detects glitter, it means that there is gold in the current gold and may be collected by the hunter. To achieve his mission, the hunter must infer danger by gathering knowledge about the cave.


This project aims, not to reprogram the entirety of the Wumpus World game, but to bundle a few of the essential features into a program coded using the Prolog language.
